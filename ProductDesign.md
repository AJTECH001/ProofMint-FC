# ProofMint AI - Product Design Documentation


## Problem Definition & Market Relevance

### The $500B E-Waste Crisis
- **Scale**: 62 million tonnes of e-waste generated annually, only 22.3% recycled
- **Economic Loss**: $500B in valuable materials lost to improper disposal
- **Trust Gap**: Fraud in recycling claims and opaque supply chains erode consumer confidence
- **Payment Friction**: Current systems lack integrated payment rails for sustainability incentives

### Filecoin Relevance
ProofMint AI directly addresses Filecoin's vision of programmable storage by creating a sustainable commerce ecosystem where every purchase receipt becomes verifiable, tamper-proof data stored on-chain.

## Solution & Value Proposition

### Core Innovation: Receipts-as-a-Service on Filecoin
Transform traditional receipts into intelligent NFTs with embedded sustainability data, leveraging Filecoin's decentralized storage and payment infrastructure.

### Value Propositions:
1. **For Merchants**: Reduce payment disputes, attract eco-conscious consumers, automate sustainability reporting
2. **For Consumers**: Verifiable proof of purchase, carbon footprint tracking, recycling rewards
3. **For Recyclers**: Guaranteed payment streams, verified product authenticity, enhanced material recovery

## Technical Architecture with Filecoin Onchain Cloud

### Deep Integration Strategy

#### 1. FilecoinWarmStorageService (Primary Storage Layer)
```javascript
// Receipt NFT metadata structure stored on Filecoin
{
  "receiptId": "0x...",
  "merchantId": "merchant_001",
  "purchaseData": {
    "items": [...],
    "timestamp": "2024-09-01T10:00:00Z",
    "carbonFootprint": "2.5kg CO2eq"
  },
  "sustainabilityMetrics": {
    "recyclabilityScore": 85,
    "materialComposition": {...},
    "eolInstructions": "..."
  },
  "recyclingHistory": [
    {
      "stage": "collection",
      "timestamp": "2024-12-01T10:00:00Z",
      "verifiedBy": "0x...",
      "location": "San Francisco, CA"
    }
  ]
}
```

**PDP Integration**: All receipt data verified through Proof of Data Possession, ensuring tamper-proof sustainability claims.

#### 2. Filecoin Pay Integration (Payment & Incentive Layer)
```solidity
contract ProofMintEscrow {
    using FilecoinPay for address;
    
    struct Purchase {
        address buyer;
        address merchant;
        uint256 amount;
        bytes32 receiptHash;
        bool verified;
    }
    
    mapping(bytes32 => Purchase) public purchases;
    
    function createPurchase(
        address merchant,
        bytes32 receiptHash
    ) external payable {
        // Escrow FIL/ERC-20 tokens until receipt verification
        purchases[receiptHash] = Purchase({
            buyer: msg.sender,
            merchant: merchant,
            amount: msg.value,
            receiptHash: receiptHash,
            verified: false
        });
    }
    
    function releasePayment(bytes32 receiptHash) external {
        require(verifyReceipt(receiptHash), "Receipt not verified");
        Purchase storage purchase = purchases[receiptHash];
        purchase.merchant.transfer(purchase.amount);
        purchase.verified = true;
    }
}
```

**Streaming Recycling Rewards**: Continuous payments to recyclers as they progress through sustainability milestones.

#### 3. FilCDN Integration (Performance Layer)
- **Global Edge Caching**: Receipt data cached at CDN edges for <100ms retrieval times
- **Mobile Optimization**: Compressed sustainability data for mobile POS systems
- **Real-time Verification**: Instant access to receipt authenticity for merchant systems

#### 4. Synapse SDK Integration (Developer Experience)
```typescript
import { SynapseClient } from '@filecoin/synapse-sdk';

const client = new SynapseClient();

// Store receipt metadata with PDP verification
const storeReceipt = async (receiptData) => {
  const result = await client.warmStorage.store({
    data: receiptData,
    options: { pdpVerification: true }
  });
  
  // Set up payment escrow
  await client.pay.createEscrow({
    amount: receiptData.totalAmount,
    releaseConditions: {
      verificationRequired: true,
      dataHash: result.hash
    }
  });
  
  return result.cid;
};

// Fast retrieval via FilCDN
const getReceipt = async (cid) => {
  return await client.cdn.retrieve(cid);
};
```
